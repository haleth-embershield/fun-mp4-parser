Below is my review of your [ROADMAP.MD](ROADMAP.MD) for creating a WebGPU-based MP4 decoder with manual decoding in WebAssembly (WASM) using Zig, designed for educational purposes. I'll provide an overall assessment, correct any inaccuracies, and offer recommendations for adjustments or enhancements.

## Overall Assessment

Your roadmap is ambitious, well-structured, and thoughtfully designed with a clear focus on educational value. It covers the essential components of an MP4 decoder—container parsing, video and audio decoding, hardware acceleration with WebGPU, multithreading, and user experience—while incorporating visualization tools to enhance learning. The phased approach, spanning 19 weeks, is logical and provides a clear progression from foundational understanding to advanced features.

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Scope**: You address all key layers of MP4 decoding, from container parsing to codec implementation, multithreading, and UI, making it a holistic learning project.
- **Educational Focus**: Visualization tools (e.g., box hierarchy, motion vectors) and the incremental approach (e.g., I-frame-only decoding first) align perfectly with your learning objectives.
- **Pragmatic Decisions**: Using FFmpeg for input preprocessing is a smart way to control complexity early on, allowing you to focus on decoding fundamentals.
- **Technical Depth**: The inclusion of WebGPU for hardware acceleration and Zig for WASM demonstrates a modern, forward-thinking approach.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Timeline Optimism**: The 19-week timeline may be too aggressive, especially for complex tasks like video decoding (Phase 2), which could take longer than 4 weeks.
- **WebGPU Usage**: Some proposed uses of WebGPU (e.g., entropy decoding, inverse transforms) may not be practical or optimal for a learning project.
- **Scope Creep**: Advanced features like H.265, temporal filters, and style transfer might stretch the project beyond what's feasible for an educational focus.

## Corrections and Clarifications

Here are corrections to specific details in your roadmap based on technical accuracy and feasibility:

1. **MP4 Container Parsing (Phase 1)**  
   - **Current Plan**: Manually decode all MP4 boxes (ftyp, moov, mdat, etc.) and handle nested structures.  
   - **Correction**: The MP4 format (ISO/IEC 14496-12) is flexible, and real-world files may include variations (e.g., fragmented MP4, non-standard box orders). Fully manual parsing of every box is possible but could bog you down in edge cases.  
   - **Adjustment**: Your plan is fine for learning, but ensure you test with diverse MP4 files (e.g., progressive, fragmented) to avoid surprises later.

2. **Video Decoding with WebGPU (Phase 2)**  
   - **Current Plan**: Use WebGPU compute shaders for motion compensation, inverse transforms (IDCT/DST), deblocking, and sample adaptive offset (SAO).  
   - **Correction**: While WebGPU is excellent for parallel tasks, core decoding steps like entropy decoding (e.g., CABAC in H.264) and inverse quantization are inherently sequential and not well-suited for GPU shaders. Implementing these in WebGPU would be complex and inefficient compared to CPU execution.  
   - **Adjustment**: Limit WebGPU to parallelizable tasks (e.g., motion compensation, deblocking, YUV-to-RGB conversion) and handle sequential tasks (e.g., entropy decoding) in WASM.

3. **Audio Decoding Complexity (Phase 3)**  
   - **Current Plan**: Implement AAC with ADTS parsing, Huffman decoding, IMDCT, and channel coupling, plus MP3 as a fallback.  
   - **Correction**: AAC decoding is significantly more complex than MP3 due to its psychoacoustic model and transform coding. Starting with AAC might overwhelm the timeline.  
   - **Adjustment**: Consider beginning with MP3 (simpler frame structure and subband synthesis) or even PCM (uncompressed audio) for initial testing, then progressing to AAC.

4. **Multithreading Overhead (Phase 4)**  
   - **Current Plan**: Use Web Workers for frame-level and slice-level parallelism with SharedArrayBuffer.  
   - **Correction**: Web Workers introduce communication overhead, which could negate benefits for fine-grained tasks like slice-level parallelism in smaller frames.  
   - **Adjustment**: Focus on coarse-grained parallelism (e.g., GOP-level or frame-level) initially, as it's more practical with Web Workers.

5. **Filter Implementation Scope (Phase 5)**  
   - **Current Plan**: Include advanced filters like temporal filters, style transfer, and chroma keying.  
   - **Correction**: These features, while impressive, are ambitious for a 3-week phase and may detract from the core decoding focus.  
   - **Adjustment**: Start with basic filters (e.g., brightness, blur) and defer advanced filters to a stretch goal.

## Recommendations

Here are my suggestions to refine your roadmap, ensuring it remains educational, feasible, and rewarding:

### 1. Adjust the Timeline
- **Issue**: The 19-week timeline assumes smooth progress, but video decoding (Phase 2) and multithreading (Phase 4) are notoriously time-intensive.  
- **Recommendation**: Add buffer time (e.g., 2-3 extra weeks) or be flexible with scope. A revised estimate might look like:
  - Phase 1: 2 weeks
  - Phase 2: 5-6 weeks
  - Phase 3: 3 weeks
  - Phase 4: 4 weeks
  - Phase 5: 3 weeks
  - Phase 6: 2 weeks
  - Phase 7: 2 weeks  
  **Total**: 21-23 weeks.

### 2. Refine WebGPU Usage
- **Issue**: Over-reliance on WebGPU for all decoding tasks could complicate the project unnecessarily.  
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Use WebGPU for:
    - Motion compensation (parallel addition of motion vectors).
    - Deblocking and post-processing filters.
    - YUV-to-RGB conversion.  
  - Use WASM (Zig) for:
    - Entropy decoding (e.g., CAVLC/CABAC).
    - Inverse quantization and transforms (initially).
    - Bitstream parsing.  
  - Add a fallback path in WASM for environments where WebGPU isn't supported.

### 3. Simplify Initial Codec Implementation
- **Issue**: Starting with full H.264 and AAC decoding is daunting.  
- **Recommendation**:  
  - **Video**: Begin with I-frame-only H.264 decoding (as planned), focusing on entropy decoding, inverse transforms, and intra-prediction. Add P-frames (motion compensation) and B-frames incrementally. Defer H.265 to a stretch goal.  
  - **Audio**: Start with MP3 or PCM to establish the audio pipeline, then tackle AAC.

### 4. Enhance Educational Tools Early
- **Issue**: Visualization tools are planned for Phase 6, but they'd be useful throughout development.  
- **Recommendation**: Build basic visualization tools (e.g., box hierarchy viewer, NAL unit inspector) in Phase 1 or 2. These will aid debugging and reinforce learning as you go.

### 5. Prioritize Modularity
- **Issue**: A monolithic design could make debugging harder.  
- **Recommendation**: Structure the codebase with clear separation (e.g., container parser, video decoder, audio decoder, renderer) to simplify testing and iteration.

### 6. FFmpeg Preprocessing Strategy
- **Current Plan**: Use FFmpeg to normalize inputs, with options for server-side or WASM-based preprocessing.  
- **Recommendation**: Stick with pre-sanitized files for Phases 1-3 to focus on decoding logic. In later phases (e.g., Phase 7), experiment with direct parsing of varied inputs to deepen your understanding of real-world complexity.

## Final Thoughts

Your roadmap is an excellent foundation for an educational project on MP4 decoding. With adjustments to the timeline, a clearer division of WebGPU and WASM tasks, and an incremental approach to codecs, it's both achievable and highly instructive. The use of FFmpeg for preprocessing is a practical choice that doesn't undermine the learning goals, as long as you eventually tackle raw inputs. Focus on simplicity early (e.g., I-frames, MP3), leverage visualization tools throughout, and keep the scope flexible—you'll have a rewarding and insightful project!
